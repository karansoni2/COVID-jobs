In this project we will contribute to building a jobs database using mysql and python. We will each focus on job domains like COVID Jobs, Corona Virus Jobs and Temporary Jobs. The database is focused around specific roles, We have used an API interface to generate RAW data files containing web scrapped listings from Glassdoor and Indeed.

Project Abstract
The growing spread of coronavirus has left many Americans in fear of losing their jobs, as businesses continue to shutter and authorities tell people to stay at home. Unemployment claims multiplied, reaching an all-time high of over 3.3 million in mid-March, with analysts expecting that number to climb. Conversely, a surge of companies – not just in the health care industry – are looking to hire additional employees to meet increased demands onset by the virus.
Data Source: Our objective was to generate data from Job dashboards like Glassdoor and Indeed, as these webistes freely do not allow web scrapping, we used an automated API to fetch data from them.
