# COVID-jobs
Final project for a Jobs database featuring jobs with the keywords 'COVID','corona' and 'temporary' jobs from Indeed and Glassdoor.

INFO 6210: 

Jobs Database: COVID/ Corona/ Temporary Jobs Database

Title : Jobs Database 

Author: Karan Soni 


NUID: 001448528



In this project we will contribute to building a jobs database using mysql and python. We will each focus on job domains like COVID Jobs, Corona Virus Jobs and Temporary Jobs. The database is focused around specific roles, We have used an API interface to generate RAW data files containing web scrapped listings from Glassdoor and Indeed.



Project Abstract:

The growing spread of coronavirus has left many Americans in fear of losing their jobs, as businesses continue to shutter and authorities tell people to stay at home. Unemployment claims multiplied, reaching an all-time high of over 3.3 million in mid-March, with analysts expecting that number to climb. Conversely, a surge of companies – not just in the health care industry – are looking to hire additional employees to meet increased demands onset by the virus.
Data Source: Our objective was to generate data from Job dashboards like Glassdoor and Indeed, as these webistes freely do not allow web scrapping, we used an automated API to fetch data from them.



File descriptions:

1) COVID-JOBS_DB :
    Jupyter notebook containing the main code and explanation for the INFO 6210 project, creating a Jobs-Database for workers looking for COVID jobs. 
    
 2) Webscrapping (with tutorial):
    Jupyter notebook containing the code and explanantion for a webscrapping tutorial used to scrape a list of top 10 employers hiring COVID/ Corona/ Temporary workers.
    
 3) Socialmedia (with tutorial):
    Jupyter notebook containing the code and explanation for a tutorial on how to use API to gather twitter data using the tags - #covidjob, #coronavirusjobs and #temporaryjobs. 
    
    
 Report: 
 
 Reports are indiviually included in the Jupyter notebooks of the three files. 
 
 
 List of tasks permormed as per DB project portfolio guidelies (https://github.com/nikbearbrown/INFO_6210/blob/master/Project/Project_Portfolio.ipynb):
 
1) Build the list of companies in some domain - webscrapping.ipnyb 
2) Web scrape the data for each of the companies for job details - COVID-Jobs_db.ipynb
3) Automate the scraping - using the APIfy interface
4) Get additional relevant data from sites like Glassdoor, LinkedIn (one per person) - using the Glassdoor APIfy interface
5) Get data from social media sites – Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Steam, Twitter, etc.. (One per person) - socialmedia.ipnby
6) Tag the social media posts, including synonyms for the tags- socialmedia.ipnby
7) Clean and integrate data- COVID-Jobs_db.ipynb
8) Build an ER diagram and model the db- COVID-Jobs_db.ipynb
9) Build the dB schema and insert the data- schema.ipynb
10) Generate use cases- use_cases.ipynb
11) Optimize the database- COVID-Jobs_db.ipynb
12) Properly document that database- COVID-Jobs_db.ipynb
13) Professionalism (Licensing, code style, file naming, README. Etc.) - https://github.com/karansoni2/COVID-jobs

 
 
 Conclusion: 
 
 Based on the concepts learned in the INFO 6210 DMDD coursework, we have implemented- 
 a) Web scrapping, 
 b) Social Media API, 
 c) Data Auditing, 
 d) Data Manipulation, 
 c) Data Normalisation 
 and other Database Management techniques.
