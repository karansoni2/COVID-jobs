Job-Specific Responsibilities

The Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness (www.isc.hbs.edu) is a joint Institute of Harvard University and Harvard Business School, dedicated to supporting and extending the research pioneered by Professor Porter and disseminating it to scholars and practitioners on a global basis. The Institute is focused on the study of competition and its implications for the strategy of companies and other types of organizations, the competitiveness of nations, regions and cities, and new ways to address social challenges such as health care, environmental impact, corporate social responsibility, and philanthropy.

The Research Associate, based at the ISC and working directly with Professor Porter and team, will focus almost exclusively on Professor Porter’s health care research stream. There may also be some opportunity to work on strategy or economic development depending on the candidate.

Professor Porter’s 2006 book, Redefining Health Care, offers a value-based framework for understanding the problems in health care delivery in the United States and other countries (http://www.hbs.edu/rhc/index.html). A large body of additional research and curriculum development has occurred over the past several years. As a member of Professor Porter’s value-based health care team, the Research Associate will assist Professor Porter in advancing this research, including contributing to research projects in the ISC, and in partnership with outside organizations. The Research Associate is expected to develop case studies and other teaching materials, peer-reviewed publications, and aid in policy and management research. The Research Associate will also assist with developing presentations to domestic and international audiences, and representing Professor Porter to important constituencies.

The Research Associate will assist with the content development and administration of Professor Porter’s health care courses, currently including a week-long intensive seminar for Harvard graduate students and practicing physicians as well as two 3-day Senior Executive programs for C-level representatives of leading health care organizations.

The mission of the MassCyberCenter is to enhance conditions for economic growth through outreach to the cybersecurity ecosystem of Massachusetts while fostering cybersecurity resiliency within the Commonwealth. The Outreach and Event Program Manager is essential to the mission center by communicating key information concerning cybersecurity activities to enhance collaboration and resiliency planning within the Commonwealth.

Since 2017, the MassCyberCenter has hosted three invitation-only Cybersecurity Forums to bring together Massachusetts world-class cybersecurity ecosystem. The Forum format is a full day of activities, starting with a luncheon, followed by break-out Trek Sessions and ending with a reception. Past forums featured Governor Charlie Baker, Massachusetts Senate President Karen Spilka, Former Defense Secretary Ash Carter, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Christopher Krebs and CEO of Rapid7 Corey Thomas. Past Forum locations included Cambridge, the Seaport, the State House and the new Rapid7 Headquarters at North Station.

The MassCyberCenter organized the first ever Massachusetts Cybersecurity Week in 2019 to coincide with the Forum in order to expand cybersecurity awareness across the state over multiple days and events. The week consisted of a Governor’s proclamation, a digital public service campaign for senior citizens as well as several events designed to examine cybersecurity issues relating to cybersecurity ecosystem diversity in the cybersecurity work force and computer science/cybersecurity programs at colleges and universities. MassTech coordinated the Baker-Politio Administration participation in several “signature” events by arranging for speakers, such as Secretary for Housing and Economic Development Mike Kennealy at the .406 Ventures investment in cybersecurity sector.

For 2020, Cybersecurity Week is being expanded to Cybersecurity Month for the entirety of October 2020, to better align Massachusetts with National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, and to allow more flexibility in key leaders’ calendars to support “signature” events. The 2020 Cybersecurity Forum will be held on a date to be determined during the Cybersecurity Month, based on Governor Baker’s availability.

The primary role of for this position is to plan and execute the Cybersecurity Month and Forum as well as support other efforts of the MassCyberCenter to engage stakeholders.

Job Summary

The Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University seeks an enthusiastic Senior Staff Scientist to join the Institute’s Brain Targeting Program to focus on the antibody shuttle research and development. This position is an exciting opportunity to combine cutting edge, hands-on research with the strategic considerations of technology translation and product development.

The Institute’s Brain Targeting Program is using novel human in vitro models of the blood brain barrier (BBB) to develop improved methods of transporting therapeutics and diagnostics across the BBB into the CNS (https://wyss.harvard.edu/technology/brain-targeting-shuttles-for-drug-delivery-and-diagnostics/). It’s core projects at present include a target discovery effort directed to identifying proteins on the BBB endothelial cell surface that are highly expressed and are enriched compared to endothelial cells from other organs. These proteins will be evaluated for their potential to transport cargoes across the BBB by one of several mechanisms, and then tested to validate and prioritize them for generation of antibody shuttles that bind to them. We are currently developing novel antibody shuttles directed against several known Ab shuttle targets. These will be tested in the human in vitro transwell and BBB-Chip assays, and eventually in humanized mouse models. The Wyss team is collaborating with several biopharmaceutical companies and other academic institutions to advance the BBB antibody shuttle program. We are also pursuing multiple other exploratory projects including an Alzheimer’s-on-Chip model, connections between the brain and the gut, and testing of small molecule BBB shuttles. The Brain Targeting Program is part of the Ingber lab’s Bioinspired Therapeutics and Diagnostics platform, which includes more than 20 Organ-on-Chip models and related projects. The group is collaborative and collegial and has extensive interactions between projects, people and institutions.","Place","PostalAddress","Country","US","Boston","MA",,"GeoCoordinates","42.3583","-71.0603","Senior Staff Scientist","MonetaryAmount","USD","QuantitativeValue","98845","66675","YEAR","https://www.glassdoor.com/job-listing/senior-staff-scientist-harvard-medical-school-JV_IC1154532_KO0,22_KE23,45.htm?jl=3524645971"

The same data also provides opportunities for research and discovery.

The Clinical Genomic Analysis Platform (CGAP) at Harvard Medical School is envisioned as scalable research and clinical web-based application for analysis, annotation, visualization, and reporting of genomic data. CGAP is developed by a multidisciplinary team of clinical geneticists, bioinformatics scientists and software engineers. The working environment combines the best features of a startup (fast pace, flexibility, flat hierarchies) with those of one of the leading medical schools (excellent benefits, outstanding opportunities for learning, great resources, brand recognition).

CGAP is currently seeking a full-time Bioinformatics Scientist to enhance the analysis of DNA sequencing data for our growing Genomics Program. The scope of this role will include developing, automating, and implementing leading-edge genetic software tools. These tools will facilitate the identification and annotation of disease-causing genetic variants of patients at the clinic.
