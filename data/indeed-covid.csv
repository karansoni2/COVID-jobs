"Do you love seeing your primary care provider? Do you believe they have your back, working with you to achieve your health goals? Can you have a conversation with your primary care team right now?
Are you thrilled by how much money you, your loved ones, and your employer are paying for healthcare?
Sadly, not many people can say “yes” to these questions. Here at Firefly Health, we believe everyone should have great primary care. Founded by experienced physician innovators and technology entrepreneurs, we marry sophisticated technology with a thoughtful care team experience for continuous, intelligent, and proactive care. And technology is not just a means to an end — it is core to how we care for people. Our care team partners with you to achieve your personal health goals, helping you (and your wallet) get better and stay well.
Firefly Health is building the future of primary care. If you share our revolutionary spirit and a love of caring for others, this just might be the place for you. We are building a culture that values our patients, our people, rising to challenges together, using technology to empower people, and being responsible to the world.
Requirements
NPs and PAs form the core of each Firefly care team - each team will have three NPs or PAs once full panel size is reached. They are responsible for establishing care with new patients, including creating each patient’s longitudinal care plan.

Oversee and mentor health coordinators, who will conduct regular video or in-person visits to monitor progress toward goals
Liaise with mental health team to triage, diagnose, and treat mental illness that is appropriate for primary care setting
Acute complaints:
triage new complaints that arise from patients via Firefly mobile application, or phone calls
for straightforward problems, manage via rapid video visit
for non-straightforward problems, triage to video visits or in-person visits with Firefly care team or partner organization
manage care plan to incorporate new issues, ensure follow-up
Prevention and wellness:
Working with patients, develop wellness and prevention goals, using standard templates for prevention (eg, cancer screenings, immunizations)
Work with team to develop and implement tools to help patients manage wellness goals, including protocols and third -party applications
You’ll be a good fit if you:
