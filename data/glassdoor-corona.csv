We are currently getting geared up for a huge wave of sales coming in this industry as 70% of US merchants will be updating their payment processing equipment due to a common device that the manufacturer has announced to be “end of life”, meaning the device will no longer be supported. We also anticipate a huge boom once the current Corona-virus/COVID-19 issue is out of the picture.

We are looking for prospectors and closers who want a long term residual book that continues to pay you long after you have stopped working-

Most sales reps working with other companies are sick of being underpaid on their current residual book, we have been a home for these sales reps to bring their book of business over to since 2004. BPS will pay you better with upfront bonuses and help you close your sales. Our back end support that includes helping program equipment, deploy and helping your merchants after the sale is second to none-
