"**Description**

We are the world’s learning company with more than 24,000 employees operating in 70 countries. We combine world-class educational content and assessment,powered by services and technology, to enable more effective teaching and personalized learning at scale. We believe that wherever learning flourishes so do people.

The OnVUE Greeter and Proctor roles are responsible for the check- in and live monitoring of candidates who are testing remotely via Pearson VUE’s Online Proctored (OnVUE) delivery mode. Pearson VUE relies heavily upon both roles to ensure the security and integrity of exams, and to provide a smooth and positive candidate testing experience. 

The primary responsibility of greeters is to check candidates in for testing; check-in steps include verifying candidate identify via ID check and reviewing the candidate’s testing environment to ensure security compliance. Most interactions can occur via chat, but phone contacts are also available if the greeter has a mic and/or headset. Greeters also aid and provide an escalation path to Pearson VUE support teams when issues arise during the check-in process.

The primary responsibility of proctors is to ensure a secure testing process for the duration of the exam. Proctors intervene if a candidate breaks key rules (provided to them ahead of testing) that put either exam content or the integrity of testing at risk; these rules include use of a mobile phone or paper/pencil, leaving the room while testing, and allowing a third party to enter the room. Proctors also aid and provide an escalation path to Pearson VUE support teams when issues arise during testing. Most interactions can occur via chat, but phone contacts are also available if the proctor has a mic and/or headset. 

**Qualifications**

Successful candidates will have excellent communication skills, great attention to detail and a strong customer service focus. 

**Assignment details **

This is a temporary assignment scheduled to start within the next 2 weeks. It’s estimated to run approximately through early June, although the end date may fluctuate based on changes in workload.

+ Work schedule:  Work schedules would be determined based on your availability responses as well as the available testing schedules.

+ Work location: This is a remote position. All work will be performed from home using your own equipment.

"Who We Are
Bridge partners with governments, donors, and parents to ensure that every child has access to an education that develops her full potential and creates the foundation for prosperity for the country. We are dedicated to supporting teachers, empowering school leaders, and ensuring every child has the learning support needed to master the national syllabus and have the confidence to succeed in a competitive world. Each of our project or country teams are supported through expertise and programming from additional offices around the world, combining world-leading expertise in core design areas with locally resident leadership and execution. We leverage experts, data, and technology in order to support and scale every aspect of quality education delivery. Bridge managed and supported schools are technology enabled and data driven to ensure accountability in the classroom for both teachers’ performance and children’s learning.
The Bridge model delivers significant learning outcomes at large scale by combining technology and customized learning materials. At Bridge, we believe innovation and technology can transform learning. Our model – which uses technology to deliver thoroughly researched and carefully designed daily lesson guides to teachers in our academies – is proven to increase learning outcomes for children. We are a solutions-driven, implementation-focused organization, using design principles to work in varied and often highly constrained contexts to ensure learning outcomes and positive development for children. Working in regional and national scales is important to us, as empowering entire generations of children with core knowledge, skills, and confidence is what builds the foundation for a peaceful and prosperous future for us all.
Our mission is to provide our pupils with a life-changing education and we believe that every child should have a right to world-class education regardless of her family’s income. Core to our approach is the conviction that every child can learn, as long as the school she attends is committed to her development and puts her needs to learn at the forefront of all decisions. We have seen teachers and children transform and excel in both government and private schools that we support and manage.
We invite you to join this incredible endeavor that is having world-changing impact across multiple continents. You will join a team of dedicated change-makers committed to ensuring that each decision we make keeps a child’s experience of learning as its guiding principle.
Academics Group
The objective of the Academics group is to drive student achievement. To do so, we must know - what is happening minute-by-minute for the typical child. The student’s daily experience, and thus the path to achievement, emerges from their relationship with the teachers and the content that is delivered in the classroom. Our team is collaboratively organised around these levers. We develop rigorous content pitched at the right level for students to be delivered by a teacher who is prepared to succeed in the classroom. Our Instructional Design department builds the content; our Leadership & Development department trains teachers and school leaders using scientifically-proven techniques; our Learning Innovation department looks at cutting-edge research to generate breakthrough learning gains. Underpinning all of this is the work of the independent Measurement and Evaluation group, which provides Academics with an empirical orientation toward improving that daily experience and, in turn, driving achievement.
Instructional Design
The Instructional Design department produces the learning materials that are used in our schools across our communities. This department has team members based in multiple Bridge support offices, organised into teams that each work on a portfolio of projects. Driving student achievement through the development of rigorous content is the number one priority. One core tenet of the approach is less lecture (traditional among many schools in our markets) and more student practice. Consistent, rigorous opportunities to refine his or her skills are crucial to a child’s learning progression. The Instructional Design department structures all lessons, textbooks, and other materials to ensure this.
About the Role
The Instructional Design department seeks an experienced proofreader for a full-time, short-term contract role (40 hours per week, approximately 2 months). In this role, you will proofread instructional materials created by our globally distributed team, under the supervision of our managing editor. This work supports a high-priority launch in a new territory, and so besides excellent proofreading skills, it requires flexibility, calm, and the ability to produce excellent work in a fast-paced environment.
You are highly detail-oriented with a nuanced understanding of proofreading conventions; you’ve probably noticed several things in this posting that you’re itching to fix. Your poise and experience as a proofreader make you a source of calm in stressful environments; you are unfazed by a change to the style guide or a sudden reordering of your priorities, and you can effortlessly adjust to the requirements of a particular project.
The Instructional Design team is located in Boston, Nairobi, Hyderabad, and Lagos. This role is based in Boston, but will very likely include remote collaboration with teams overseas.
What You Will Do
Proofread and correct daily lessons (“teacher guides”) electronically, directly in our CMS and in Word files
Check answer keys and references to textbooks for accuracy
Proofread other instructional materials as assigned
Create and maintain a highly organized system for tracking lessons through the proofreading process
Develop a style sheet and editing guidelines for Instructional Design writers
Provide feedback and statistics about lesson quality to the managing editor
What You Should Have
Demonstrated proofreading experience
Ability to edit electronically in Word and online in our CMS (experience with XML desirable)
Ability to work on all primary school subjects (including mathematics)
Experience working with British English (ideally in an international/global English context)
Exceptional attention to details and meticulous organization
Excellent responsiveness and communicativeness; ability to adapt to changing specifications
Ability to work onsite in our Boston-area (Cambridge) office (remote work possible after a two-week training/trial period)
Ability to start immediately
You’re also
A detailed doer – You have a track record of getting things done. You’re organized and responsive. You take ownership of every idea you touch and execute it to a fine level of detail, setting targets, engaging others, and doing whatever it takes to get the job done. You can multi-task dozens of such projects at once and never lose sight of the details. Likely, you have some experience in a start-up or other rapid-growth company.
A creative problem-solver – Growing any business from scratch comes with massive and constant challenges. On top of that, Bridge works in often fragile, sometimes volatile low-resource communities and with complex government systems. You need to be flexible and ready to get everything done effectively, quickly, and affordably with the materials at hand.
A relentless advocate – The children we serve and teachers we empower never leave your mind. You know them, get them, have shared a meal with them (or would be happy to in the future). You would never shrink back from shaking a parent’s hand or picking up a crying child, no matter what the person was wearing or looked like. Every decision you make considers their benefit, experience, and value.
A malleable learner – You believe you can always do better. You welcome constructive criticism and provide it freely to others. You know you only get better tomorrow when others point out where you’ve missed things or failed today.
A data-driven decision-maker – When making decisions, you don’t rely on your intuition alone. You collect data, you analyze it and make decisions with clear justifications.
A curious investigator – You ask why a lot. You don’t just take what you see and accept it. You wonder why it is that way, and are aware that the world we see is created by human choices and actions – and it could be different. You wonder, and see the world as wonderful even when you want to change a part of it that is unjust.","06a98c5db1cdd820","","Proofreader, Instructional Design","https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=06a98c5db1cdd820&fccid=7f203a75e6b49a27&vjs=3"

About Crane Beach at The Crane Estate
At Crane Beach, you’ll enjoy one of the finest beaches and outdoor recreation destinations on the East Coast. With its clean, inviting water, miles of shoreline, and mesmerizing views, Crane Beach has been a favorite with the ocean-loving public for generations. Whether you intend to take a refreshing plunge, play in the sand, or just soak up the sun, this unparalleled seaside experience is sure to provide lots of fun – and great memories, too.
There’s more to see here than sun and sand. Crane Beach is managed for both recreation and conservation – people and ecology – through careful planning. More than five miles of trails wind through coastal dunes here, which shield inland areas from storm waves and flooding. And, Castle Neck is the site of the North Shore’s largest pitch pine forest.
Crane Beach is also among the world’s most important nesting sites for piping plovers, a threatened bird that was nearly hunted to extinction in the 19th century for its eggs and feathers. Crane Beach has been nationally recognized for its successful shorebird protection program. To protect these threatened shorebirds, we ask that you avoid the fenced nesting areas and the wrack, the line of washed-up organic debris where the birds feed and hide.

About Corbus:

Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. (NASDQ: CRBP) is a Phase 3 clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics to treat inflammatory and fibrotic diseases by leveraging its industry leading pipeline of endocannabinoid system-targeting drug candidates. The Company's lead product candidate, Lenabasum, is a novel, synthetic, oral, selective cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2) agonist designed to resolve chronic inflammation and fibrotic processes. Lenabasum is currently being evaluated in systemic sclerosis, cystic fibrosis, dermatomyositis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

Corbus licensed the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and market drug candidates from more than 600 novel compounds targeting the endocannabinoid system from Jenrin Discovery LLC. The pipeline includes CRB-4001, a 2nd generation, peripherally-restricted, selective cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) inverse agonist specifically designed to eliminate blood-brain barrier penetration and brain CB1 receptor occupancy that mediate the neuropsychiatric issues associated with first-generation CB1 inverse agonists. Potential indications for CRB-4001 include NASH, primary biliary cholangitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis, myocardial fibrosis after myocardial infarction and acute interstitial nephritis, among others. CRB-4001 is scheduled to enter a Phase 1 study in 2019 followed a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded first-in-patient Phase 2 study.

About the Bradley Estate
The gardens at the Eleanor Cabot Bradley Estate in Canton, are nested among 90 acres of bucolic fields and woodlands interlaced with trails. The gardens are the masterwork of Charles Platt who designed the house and grounds in 1902 to include a formal walled garden and terraces with sweeping views of the Boston hills, surrounded by broad lawns, meadows and gentleman’s farm. In 1945, the estate passed from Dr. Arthur Tracey Cabot to his niece, Eleanor Cabot Bradley, who continued the garden tradition by enhancing the property further with ponds, a camellia house, greenhouses, and a wide variety of specimen ornamental trees. Today the main house is used for event and wedding rentals, and the walled garden and terraces beckon as a colorful extension of the house architecture. The camellia house, woodland and kitchen gardens deepen its horticultural interest.

Compensation and Benefits:
This is a seasonal, non-exempt, hourly paid position, with an optimal start date on 5/25. This position is based at Crane Estate/Crane Beach, Ipswich MA.
The Trustees offers competitive compensation and the opportunity to be part of a dedicated team across the Commonwealth who love the outdoors, who love the distinctive charms of New England, and who believe in celebrating and protecting our special places, for everyone, forever.

About Crane Beach at The Crane Estate

At Crane Beach, you’ll enjoy one of the finest beaches and outdoor recreation destinations on the East Coast. With its clean, inviting water, miles of shoreline, and mesmerizing views, Crane Beach has been a favorite with the ocean-loving public for generations. Whether you intend to take a refreshing plunge, play in the sand, or just soak up the sun, this unparalleled seaside experience is sure to provide lots of fun – and great memories, too.

There’s more to see here than sun and sand. Crane Beach is managed for both recreation and conservation – people and ecology – through careful planning. More than five miles of trails wind through coastal dunes here, which shield inland areas from storm waves and flooding. And, Castle Neck is the site of the North Shore’s largest pitch pine forest.

Crane Beach is also among the world’s most important nesting sites for piping plovers, a threatened bird that was nearly hunted to extinction in the 19th century for its eggs and feathers. Crane Beach has been nationally recognized for its successful shorebird protection program. To protect these threatened shorebirds, we ask that you avoid the fenced nesting areas and the wrack, the line of washed-up organic debris where the birds feed and hide.

Today, the places we care about are going fast, and the forces undermining them, including climate change, are moving faster. Our passion is to protect and share with everyone the irreplaceable natural and cultural treasures under our care.

About Weir River Farm & World’s End
Weir River Farm is a picturesque 75-acre working farm and is one of the last farms in Hingham. The signature Belted Galloways, barnyard animals, beautiful trails, engaging education programs, and surrounding diverse wildlife habitat are what make this farm such a special place to the community of Hingham and surrounding towns. At the farm, we have an interdisciplinary, hands-on approach to learning, in the fields and forests, the Learning Garden, and the barnyard. We offer summer camp, preschool programs, seasonal festivals, farm dinners, family programs, and more. Our programs connect children and families to the land and the natural systems that support us all, while spending time outdoors, exploring, making friends, and having fun.

World’s End is a 251-acre peninsula comprised of fields traversed by tree lined avenues, intertidal rocky shores, and drumlins, offering spectacular views of the surrounding South Shore towns set within Boston Harbor. The surrounding context of urban skyline and suburban development emphasizes the property’s iconic pastoral scenery that offers a tranquil experience within a greater metropolitan landscape. The property’s fields, five miles of undeveloped coastline in Boston Harbor, and rare plant communities provide vitally important habitat for a myriad of both flora and fauna. The one hundred acres of fields support many grassland-dependent plants and animals whose habitat is otherwise vanishing quickly from the coastal Massachusetts landscape as well as the regional landscape beyond. Programming at World’s End offers people of all ages a chance to explore this varied habitat and learn while surrounded by natural beauty.

Overview:
Precollege Programs at Brandeis offer an academically rigorous residential experience (from one to four weeks) for rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors in high school. Precollege has two aims: creating community for Jewish teens through our signature Genesis program, which seeks to build a strong, vibrant community of future Jewish leaders; and creating opportunity for low income and underrepresented teens, which enable bright, curious youth to experience the academic and residential life of Brandeis - and to consider rigorous higher education as part of their future. Through our Precollege programs, we provide access and opportunities for high school students to explore academic pursuits with accomplished Brandeis faculty and with a group of peers from different backgrounds, cultures, and practices, while previewing student life on a college campus.

The classroom experience is complemented by trips and activities and by workshops and lectures on project management, design thinking, and creating a pitch deck. Participants combine these technical, business, and marketing aspects while working on their own projects designing and building an app from concept to product and presenting their idea to professional developers at companies such as Google.
Responsibilities include:
Developing course curriculum;
Delivering opening session lecture for students;
Assisting with program promotion during marketing and recruitment cycle;
Providing guidance on possible guest lecturers and co-curricular site visits and events;

"Since Boston is announcing prolonged school closure upon the outbreak of COVID-19, and as most childcare facilities follow suit, healthcare workers, first responders, and other emergency personnel have been left with no obvious solutions for childcare.

"Why This Role is Important to Us:
Commonwealth Care Alliance’s (CCA) Clinical Response Unit (CRU) is primarily responsible for receiving, addressing, and as necessary, triaging incoming member calls related to clinical conditions or concerns.

Clinical Response Social Worker interactions require a symptom/clinical complaint/needs assessment, member education, and intervention. The Clinical Response Social Worker collects sufficient data related to the presenting issue, any pertinent history and interventions planned or in progress to date – and recognizes and matches patterns to those in the team decision protocol, assigns acuity to the issue and initiates next steps accordingly which is clearly documented in eCW.

Clinical Response Social Worker is focused on the evaluation of and disposition of issue-based calls rather than message taking. Clinical Response Unit does not replace functions that belong with the Care Partner: making diagnoses, determining eligibility for requested services, initiating services in lieu of the care team, nor prior authorization reviews.

An additional CRU Social Worker function is the service of episodic, benefit guided care coordination needs for members who have not yet been assigned a Care Partner. The CRU Social Worker will perform the necessary steps to accommodate reasonable/time-sensitive member requests for services. If the services requested are determined not appropriate for immediate fulfillment (as member hasn’t yet been assessed or case reviewed by his/her permanent Care Partner), CRU Social Worker will note/hand off these requests for future evaluation and determination by assessment staff and/or permanent Care Partner.
What You'll Be Doing:
Receive, screen, triage, and respond to incoming telephone calls from members seeking clinical/behavioral direction and advice
Accurately assess each member’s need by actively listening to caller and asking probative questions.
Identify emergent situations and effectively dispatch life-threatening calls to appropriate facilities per protocol
Make appropriate recommendations to include advice, appointments, or direction from clinicians
Collaborate with community-based care providers, to facilitate access to necessary care for members prior to their assignment to a CCA care partner. This will include notification to specific CCA authorization teams for service authorizations, utilization review, and varied prior authorization reviews.
Ensure member understands and accepts advice/recommendations given
After Hours: Connect member with other appropriate clinicians, when necessary, e.g. on-call staff
Deploy CCA resources to respond to urgent member needs in coordination with care partners (e.g., acute community care paramedic, interdisciplinary site team member, etc.).
Appropriately document calls received with adherence to required standard documentation
Assist members in empathetic, efficient manner to determine best course of action to resolve issue
Demonstrate ability to make quick decisions, based on sound base of critical thinking skills
What We're Looking For:
Master's Degree or equivalent experience
LICSW or LMHC actively licensed in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
Minimum of 5 years’ experience in a variety of settings inclusive of both medical and behavioral health
Community behavioral health services experience, strongly preferred.
Case management or related experience, strongly preferred
Experience making quick decisions, based on sound base of critical thinking skills
Excellent interpersonal, verbal and written communication skills
Skilled at providing reassurance and thoughtful attention to members’ concerns
Skilled at providing explanations, suggestions and guidance in layman’s terms
Broad comprehensive understanding of medical and behavioral diagnoses
Familiar with documenting in an electronic medical record
