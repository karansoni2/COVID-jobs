SNEP is a geographically-based program intended to serve as a collaborative framework for advancing ecosystem resiliency, protecting and restoring water quality, habitat, and ecosystem function, and developing and applying innovative policy, science, and technology to environmental management in southeast coastal New England. A critical aspect of this framework is the integration of physical processes, water quality, and critical habitat at a regional, watershed, and/or landscape scale. This ecosystem-based approach increases the effectiveness of regional restoration efforts to enhance the impact and scale of local efforts and limit duplication. It enables sharing of financial and management resources, and builds sustainable frameworks and partnerships needed to invest in wise restoration and proactive measures over the long-term. More information on the program can be found here: https://www.epa.gov/snecwrp.
Under the guidance of a mentor, the participant will have the opportunity to be involved with a number of SNEP projects including but not limited to:

Contributing to a “State of the Region” report
Researching the timing and extent of algal blooms in the region
Cataloging monitoring efforts and collaborations in the region
Identifying and researching key information gaps in water quality data in the SNEP region
Identifying and researching key information gaps and benefits of ecosystem services in the SNEP region as they pertain to water quality
Evaluating ecosystem services and functions provided by SNEP’s watersheds
Contributing to facilitation and report synthesis for SNEP’s Monitoring Subcommittee and Ecosystem Services Subcommittee
Assessing the effectiveness of innovative approaches to restore ecological integrity in SNEP coastal waters
Contributing to the planning and execution of workshops and Subcommittee meetings
Participating in identifying and sustaining involvement of stakeholders including contributing to the development of a SNEP communications plan
Investigating innovative regulatory tools, management approaches, and technological advances that may better incorporate ecosystem restoration practices as tools to improve water quality in the SNEP region, and beyond

This research opportunity will provide a unique chance to understand and participate in a regional scale effort to advance the tools and opportunities available for more collaborative and innovative management of environmental problems. The participant will be exposed to a broad range of environmental issues, both technical and policy, and will have the opportunity to interact with high-level stakeholders in the public, private, and nongovernmental sectors.
Anticipated Appointment Start Date: Summer 2020 (Please note: start date and interview process may be impacted by the current COVID-19 situation)
This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and EPA. The appointment will initially be for one year and may be renewed upon recommendation of EPA contingent on the availability of funds. The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The annual stipend will be $57,043.

"RESEARCHER


UPDATE (April 13, 2020): In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, we believe that helping smallholder farmers ensure their food security and livelihoods is more important than ever. Because PAD's advisory services are digital, we are able to continue and even expand most of our services while our staff work remotely from their homes. We are still actively hiring for the role below, and we encourage qualified applicants to apply.


PAD is a rapidly scaling global non-profit that harnesses the power of technology, data science and behavioral economics to provide targeted information to farmers in developing countries. Providing the right information to the right people, in the right way and at the right time, increases incomes, protects the environment and improves well-being. We are evidence-based: we test our interventions with randomised controlled trials to prove our impact and cost effectiveness, to simultaneously learn from and improve our service, and to demonstrate our value to funders and partners. There are few programmes in international development that are as demonstrably cost effective as ours. We currently work in seven countries in Africa and Asia, and are expanding as more governments and organisations look for innovative ways to use new technologies to empower people across the developing world.


We are looking for a driven, creative and independent person to join a high-performing flexible team. As Researcher, you will work closely with PAD and affiliated researchers to provide guidance to PAD country teams in designing and implementing A/B tests and experimental research projects, and contribute to analyzing data and generating research outputs, including journal articles, working papers, presentations, policy briefs, and partner/donor reports. You will also support other implementation and management tasks to ensure the quality of PAD’s work across geographies.PAD conducts research to inform program designs, identify market and behavioral failures, and test potential solutions using latest technologies and data, as well as insights from behavioral economics and data science and works closely with leading researchers, including Shawn Cole of Harvard Business School, Nobel Laureate for Economic Sciences, Michael Kremer of Harvard University’s department of economics, and Dan Bjorkegren, a leading researcher working at the intersection of data science and development economics at Brown University.


Responsibilities


The Researcher will be responsible for the following main tasks:


Work closely with PAD scientific advisors, PAD researchers, and other affiliated researchers to coauthor journal articles, working papers, and policy briefs based on A/B tests and RCTs conducted by PAD and its partners

Present research and represent PAD at relevant conferences and other outreach events.

Develop new research ideas that support Precision Agriculture for Development (PAD)’s programs and partners across geographies through research projects.

Oversee the lifecycle of research projects including development, proposal implementation, and review and management stages.

Provide guidance to PAD’s field teams to design and carry out exploratory research, A/B tests, evaluations, and data analysis

Provide oversight to Research Assistants, Research Managers, and Data Managers across PAD geographies.

Ensure data quality remains high and that documentation for research projects is properly maintained.

Develop or contribute substantially to proposal applications for prospective funders and partners, alongside other PAD team members.

Contribute to grant and funder reporting requirements.

Contribute to general management tasks important for PAD’s functioning and success


Qualifications


Required Qualifications and Experience:


PhD in economics, agricultural economics, public policy, or related field

Experience with research in developing countries

Experience with field experiments

"Do you love seeing your primary care provider? Do you believe they have your back, working with you to achieve your health goals? Can you have a conversation with your primary care team right now?
Are you thrilled by how much money you, your loved ones, and your employer are paying for healthcare?
Sadly, not many people can say “yes” to these questions. Here at Firefly Health, we believe everyone should have great primary care. Founded by experienced physician innovators and technology entrepreneurs, we marry sophisticated technology with a thoughtful care team experience for continuous, intelligent, and proactive care. And technology is not just a means to an end — it is core to how we care for people. Our care team partners with you to achieve your personal health goals, helping you (and your wallet) get better and stay well.
Firefly Health is building the future of primary care. If you share our revolutionary spirit and a love of caring for others, this just might be the place for you. We are building a culture that values our patients, our people, rising to challenges together, using technology to empower people, and being responsible to the world.
Requirements
NPs and PAs form the core of each Firefly care team - each team will have three NPs or PAs once full panel size is reached. They are responsible for establishing care with new patients, including creating each patient’s longitudinal care plan. They are responsible for triage and treatment of new complaints, management of chronic disease, and collaborating with our integrated behavioral health team to manage depression and anxiety. They work closely and collaboratively with physicians, peer NPs and PAs, and health guides to manage a panel of patients as a team.

Oversee and mentor health coordinators, who will conduct regular video or in-person visits to monitor progress toward goals
Liaise with mental health team to triage, diagnose, and treat mental illness that is appropriate for primary care setting
Acute complaints:
triage new complaints that arise from patients via Firefly mobile application, or phone calls
for straightforward problems, manage via rapid video visit
for non-straightforward problems, triage to video visits or in-person visits with Firefly care team or partner organization
manage care plan to incorporate new issues, ensure follow-up
Prevention and wellness:
Working with patients, develop wellness and prevention goals, using standard templates for prevention (eg, cancer screenings, immunizations)
Work with team to develop and implement tools to help patients manage wellness goals, including protocols and third -party applications
You’ll be a good fit if you:
Are a graduate of state-accredited nurse practitioner or physician assistant program
