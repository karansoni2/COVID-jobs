We have thought long and hard about what limits journalisms ability to effect positive change in the public interest, and we see two factors that dominate the landscape: (1) Commercial entities overly concerned with meeting financial goals and filling eyeball quotas while keeping up with the rest of the pack, thereby ensuring a sameness and superficiality to the coverage (2) Ideologically driven outfits that cater to a specific mindset and dare not reveal things that would upset their readers or force them to reconsider their values.

At WhoWhatWhy, we go at each story with an open mind, boundless curiosity, and a willingness to dig deep and ask hard questions even when were told not to. Nothing is going to stand in our way when it comes to discovering what is going on beneath the surface, and why. Call it naive to believe such fearlessness possible, but we think its the essence of true journalism.

And because were straight to the point, we make clear that were looking for volunteers skilled volunteers. Yes, were a nonprofit that wasnt funded by a zillionaire. Yes, we decline to accept corporate ads. Yes, we have a tiny budget right now and simply don't have the ability to pay many people very much.

Nothing is going to stand in our way when it comes to discovering what is going on beneath the surface, and why.

At PathAI, we're applying it in amazing ways to pathology, healthcare, and detecting cancer and other diseases. We're applying our work to drug development, the clinical space, and as a global health initiative.

For us, it's early days a fast-growing, in-demand business and the need for a security team that helps keep us quick and nimble while protecting the sensitive customer and patient data we handle.

We're looking for a security engineer to join our team and help us continue to move both fast and safely so we can have the most impact on the outcomes of patients facing serious diseases. We want a security team that builds automated tools and pipelines to help make security and compliance here at PathAI easy, instant, and omnipresent. If you're the right candidate, you'll be part of the team in no time:


Contribute to the design, build, and maintenance of PathAI's security architecture and infrastructure.
Lead and conduct research into vulnerabilities that affect networks, servers, instances, and containers across multiple products and environments.
Model threats that could impact our AWS/cloud and data center environments, and practically apply principles, best practices, and relevant standards.
Build monitoring systems, instrument containers, and scan networks.
Support risk management and compliance activities, building tools and infrastructure in code so we can spend less time producing documentation and evidence.
Work with product engineers and product managers, when appropriate, to mitigate discovered risks and threats, and evangelize best practices and security tooling.
Value automation of processes, helping security tooling to be transparent and ubiquitous throughout the PathAI technology stack.

Requirements:

Our employees come in all shapes and sizes, but to be successful in this role with us, you'll at least need:


Experience. This role will require at least 2-4 years experience working in the software development industry as an engineer with responsibilities relating to both security and DevOps.
Exposure. You shouldn't be a newcomer to the key components in our stack. Web technologies, Python, AWS, Linux, containers (Docker, Kubernetes), and CI/CD pipelines should be a part of your repertoire. You don't need to be an expert in everything, but you should have been around the block once or twice.
Education. Generally, a bachelor's degree in a relevant field is really helpful in working with our team on this kind of work. But feel free to convince us if you're the exception.
Tenacity. We're doing some big things, and we'll find some roadblocks along the way, big and small. A big part of this role is keeping an even keel and finding the route through or around the obstacles.
An insatiable intellectual curiosity and the ability to learn quickly in a complex space.

Benefits:

For the right candidate, we'll offer a competitive salary plus equity. We have a strong benefits package, including heavily-subsidized health, dental, and vision insurance plans to keep you in peak shape. It's rounded out by:


Flexible work hours
Three weeks of paid leave per year, plus holidays and extended leave
Convertible sit-stand desks
Your choice of computer equipment
Free lunch on Tuesdays and Fridays
Snacks and drinks in the office which currently include a mountain of Milano cookies and cold brew coffee and green tea on tap.

Most importantly, you'll be doing important work with a team of people you'll enjoy spending the day with.

We base our employment decisions on business needs, job requirements, and qualifications that's all.
